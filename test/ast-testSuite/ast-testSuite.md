# AST tests
These tests are used to cover all Javascript parsers available.

## Deployment
These tests need deployment.

The following files:

- `test-MozillaAst-program1.[js|json]`

Are files associated to each other. The `js` file will not be used by tests but they are used as reference to understand what corresponding `json` files describe. 

**Important** Each `js` file has a description about what it is needed to do to generate the corresponding `json` file.
