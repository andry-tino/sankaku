 *     SpiderMonkeyProcess --file=<path-to-this-file>
 * 
 * Print returned value of that function and copy/paste it in
 * file corresponding `-ast.json` file.
 * 
 * Remember:
 * Tests will not use this file, but its corresponding `-ast.json` file!
 * So always be sure these two files are in sync.
